# Deep Q-Learning Blackjack Agent

This project implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent to master the game of Blackjack and try to beat the dealer as often as possible. This project was made using the Flask web framework for Python, as well as simple HTML and CSS for the frontend. The DQN agent was also built using Python.

Blackjack is a very simple game. The goal is to get to a score of 21 (or as close to it as possible), but without going over, which results in a "bust". Detailed rules for the game can be found [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack).
